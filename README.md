# E-commerce-Analysis-using-AWS-components
The project involved a comprehensive analysis of 10 e-commerce stocks, focusing on their  trends during the first two weeks of April 23. The key technologies used : AWS(Lambda, Athena, Glue, and EMR,), Python, SQL
The project was divided into four main components:

#### 1. Data Transformer (Lambda Function): 
A Lambda function was employed to gather and transform the data. It facilitated the collection and processing of relevant information from
various sources.

#### 2. Data Collector (Kinesis Stream): 
A Kinesis stream serves as a repository for the collected data. It provided a scalable and reliable solution for storing and managing the streaming
data.

#### 3. Data Analyzer (Serverless Querying with Athena): 
The project utilized a serverless process that allowed for efficient querying of data stored in Amazon S3. Athena, as a serverless query
service, enabled us to perform in-depth analysis and extract valuable insights from the
dataset.

#### 4. Data Visualization: 
The final component involved visualizing the results of the data analysis. Various visualization techniques were applied to present the trends, patterns, and volatility
of the e-commerce stocks. These visualizations offered a clear and intuitive representation of
the findings.

The project's scope extended beyond technical aspects, providing valuable insights into the ecommerce
industry. The analysis encompassed prominent e-commerce stocks such as:
#### Amazon(AMZN), Alibaba Group (BABA), Walmart (WMT), eBay (EBAY), Shopify (SHOP), Target (TGT), Best Buy(BBY), The Home Depot (HD), Costco (COST), and Kroger (KR). ####
In conclusion, this project showcased the integration of diverse technologies and provided a
comprehensive understanding of the selected e-commerce stocks, their volatility, and trends.
